            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hi! My name Is Al Amin, I am Bangladeshi and I am currently attending Temple University. I love playing soccer and lacrosse and I am very interested in space and how the human race will adapt to problems the universe throws at us. My future goal is to somehow get a space-related job through computer science. I am really interested in what lies beyond earth and hope to land a job relating to space with my computer science skills. I also hope that I become a better editor over time as a secondary option if computer science doesn't work out. A couple of my interests are again space I just have this unexplainable interest in space and I am excited about the Artemis mission. I have a passion for lacrosse and soccer and have played on many teams. For both sports, I play a defensive midfielder with an aggressive play style. I am also experienced in making websites and know HTML, CSS, JS, and some Java. On top of this, I have some skills in using Premier Pro and Vegas Pro. I hope to live a comfortable life within the next 15 years. </p>
